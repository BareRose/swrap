## Documentation

This is a header-only library, as such most of its functional documentation is contained within the "header section" of the
source code in the form of comments. It is highly recommended that you read said documentation before using this library.

## Features

The swrap library provides a cross-platform socket wrapper with automatic protocol-agnosticity, its features include:

- Encapsulates platform-specific socket implementations for both Windows and POSIX systems
- Future-proof protocol-agnosticity thanks to the system-internal getaddrinfo function
- Includes select and multi-select functions with timeouts in double seconds
